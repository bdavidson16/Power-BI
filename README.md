# Power-BI Dashboards
Here I document a summary of my Power BI projects with a description of each project and what skills I showcase within the project, as well as a PBIX/PBIT download.


| Project | Project Description | Skills | Visualization Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| ü•ß [Danny's Diner]() | May 2023 | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
| üì∫ [Foodie-Fi]() | Mar 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
| üçï [Pizza Runner]() | Mar 2023 |Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
