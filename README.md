# Power-BI Dashboards
Here I document a summary of my Power BI projects with a description of each project and what skills I showcase within the project. Within each project folder is a PBIX/PBIT download in addition to the PDF that is viewable on GitHub.


| Project | Project Description | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| ü•ß [Revenue of Movies from 2012-2016]() | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processinsg NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. | Python, GCP (Storage, Compute Engine, BigQuery), Mage, Looker Studio |
| üì∫ [TB Positives in 2023 from WHO data]() | Python, PostgreSQL, Jupyter Notebook | Designed, created, and deployed a custom data model for a dog adoption data set using Python and PostgreSQL on Jupyter Notebook. |
